# recolor
## Python script to recolor an image to the specified list of **RGB** values

**Usage** : Enter the list of RGB values like this : `R,G,B;R,G,B`, then the complete path of your image location
\n
**Warning !** It only works with .png images and I haven't added a list verification so if you make a syntax error, the script will crash
